            <p>Hi, I'm Peter Lim. I am a highly skilled software developer with a passion for solving complex technical problems and delivering innovative software solutions. My background in computer science, combined with my experience as a teacher and youth group leader, has given me a unique perspective on the importance of clear communication and teamwork in software development.</p>

            <p> I was born in South Korea and came to America in 2008. I am married with five beautiful daughters and enjoy playing sports such as pingpong, soccer, basketball, and baseball in my free time. I am also a tenor and have a passion for singing.</p>

            <p>I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science & Information and a Master of Arts in Biblical Counseling. I have also completed a JAVA Programming Certificate of Achievement and a Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp at Rutgers University. Throughout my career, I have held various roles including middle school teacher, signal officer in the South Korean army, logistic and technical support, Korean school teacher, and daycare manager.</p>

            <p>My experience as a teacher and youth group leader has honed my communication skills and my ability to lead teams towards a common goal. As a software developer, I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges, and I am confident in my ability to deliver high-quality software solutions that meet the needs of my clients.</p>

            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and bring my passion for software development to your team.</p>
